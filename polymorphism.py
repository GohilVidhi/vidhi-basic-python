polymorphism:
============

==> poly means many and morphism menas forms

==> one named method has different different forms its called polymorphism

==> there are 2 types of polymorphism

1 : method overloading :
    =================

    ==> one class can contain same name method with different signature(parameters)

    ==> note : in python this is not supported
        ====

2 : method overriding : 
    ====== ==========

    ==> two class have same name method with same parameters
